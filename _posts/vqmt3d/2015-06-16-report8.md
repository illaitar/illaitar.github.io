# VQMT3D Project: Report 8 on 3D-video Quality Analysis

* Projects, ideas: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin
* Implementation: Alexander Bokov, Alexey Fedorov, Alexey Shalpegin, Vladimir Yanushkovsky, Sergey Lavrushkin, Vyacheslav Napadovsky, Denis Sumin, Marat Arsaev, Alexander Voronov

In cooperation with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about)

## About the Report

The eighth report introduces several new technical quality metrics that
analyze geometric inconsistencies and temporal shifts between S3D views,
as well as new ones that detect swapped views and scenes that are more
prone to crosstalk while viewing. The report presents detailed (**366**
pages) evaluation results of 25 S3D films, which were natively captured
or post-converted.

The report comprises five main parts:

1.  Firstly, we present our approach to analyzing stereoscopic video for
    geometric inconsistencies and briefly explain how to understand the
    charts and visualizations. We then provide the results of our
    analysis for 25 S3D films.
2.  Then we present our results for detection of swapped views. We
    provide comprehensive information about every scene in which we
    detected swapped views using our automated technique. The report
    also presents visualizations of these scenes.
3.  The following section is dedicated to temporal shifts between views
    in stereoscopic video. We list each detected scene and present
    visualizations.
4.  We present the analysis of the crosstalk effect and of how the
    content may actually affect the amount of perceived crosstalk. It
    contains brief explanations and visualizations of the most
    crosstalk-prone frames.
5.  The report concludes with an overall technical movie comparison.
    Here we show charts depicting the average values of our metrics for
    different films.
