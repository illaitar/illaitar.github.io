# VQMT3D Project: Report 11 on 3D-video Quality Analysis

* Projects, ideas: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin
* Implementation: Alexander Bokov, Sergey Lavrushkin, Konstantin Kozhemiakov, Maxim Velikanov, Dmitriy Konovalchuk

In cooperation with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about)

## About the Report

We present the eleventh report of the Video Quality Measurement Tool for 3D ([VQMT3D](/stereo_quality/)) project, in which we provide a technical-quality analysis of selected Chinese S3D movies in comparison with Hollywood ones using a wide range of stereoscopic quality metrics.

We selected 10 Chinese S3D movies released from 2011 to 2016 and analyzed them with 6 measurable metrics and 4 qualitative metrics from our [metric list](/stereo_quality/#list-of-metrics). Detailed visualizations and notes are provided for each of the analyzed movies.

## Report contents and diagram examples

The report consists of 3 main parts:

In the beginning we explain how to interpret metric values and describe the measurement units. Measurable metrics (horizontal disparity, geometric inconsistencies, color and sharpness mismatch) provide values that can be compared numerically. For qualitative metrics only frame visualizations are included. The various charts and visualizations are also described in this section.

The next section of the report presents overall comparison charts with averaged results for measurable metrics. We use four types of charts: the first two are scatterplots, showing average metric value versus movie release date or budget. The third type of chart is a barchart, allowing easier ranking of movies. The fourth type provides more detailed comparison, as it shows the distribution of high and low-quality scenes. The plots contain data for Hollywood movies and selected Chinese movies.

The largest part of the report contains detailed analysis with per-frame visualizations for both measurable and qualitative metrics, and notes for each of the 10 Chinese S3D movies.

Our measurements focus mostly on technical quality. We don’t claim to compare “user experience”. Nevertheless, the quality of the user experience should correlate with the film’s technical quality.
