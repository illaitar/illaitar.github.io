# VirtualDub MSU Motion Phase filter

* Algorithm: Dr. Dmritriy Vatolin, Statanislav Soldatov, Konstantin Strelnikov  
* Implementation: Konstantin Strelnikov

Filter is intended for representation of moving object phases. It can be
useful for sport teaching films building. Such films allow to accent
attention on most important steps of motion.  
It combines ideas of MSU Panorama and MSU ObjectRemover project. Filter
works in two passes. On the first pass moving objects are detected. On
the second pass motion phases of selected object are built. User can
correct object detection maps to obtain best result.  
Next follow experimental results of MSU
Motion Phase.

## Examples

Picture below demonstrates motion phases of car from ***Interstate 60***
film.
