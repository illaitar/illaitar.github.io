# MSU Device Testing - determination of the 3D devices' characteristics: Tested devices

* Projects, ideas: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin
* Implementation: Denis Sumin, Alexey Fedorov

## Stereo monitor with circular polarization: Zalman ZM-M215W

We observed channels swap watching the display from different vertical angels.

We have constructed for this device the maps of 3D-perception quality per viewing position:

We have learned that the quality of 3D perception is affected by head bending in spite of circular polarization, however, high-quality 3D image is preserved in case of bending up to 15-30 degrees.

<strong>This figure is illustration of how image quality depends on head bending. The only left view of the test image is presented. The expected image shouldn't contain "2" digits but it is possible when crosstalk is high.</strong>
