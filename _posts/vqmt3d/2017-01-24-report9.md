# VQMT3D Project: Report 9 on 3D-video Quality Analysis

* Projects, ideas: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin
* Implementation: Alexander Bokov, Stanislav Dolganov, Vitaliy Lyudvichenko, Vladimir Yanushkovsky, Vyacheslav Napadovsky, Denis Sumin, Marat Arsaev, Alexander Voronov

In cooperation with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about)

## About the Report

The ninth report presents results from an analysis of **105** S3D movies
that examined temporal shifts between views and introduces a new metric
for detecting stuck-to-background objects in converted S3D scenes. The
report also introduces a classifier that determines which technique was
used during production of a scene (capture, conversion or CGI).

## Examined problems:

-   Temporal shift
-   Stuck-to-background objects
-   Detection of 2D-3D conversion and natively captured shots

The report comprises three main parts:

1.  Firstly, we present our approach to analyzing stereoscopic video for
    temporal shift. We provide the results of our analysis for 105 S3D
    films and present overall charts for these films.
2.  Then we present our new metric for detecting foreground objects
    stuck to the background of a scene. The report also presents
    visualizations of these scenes.
3.  Finally, we introduce our algorithm which classifies shots in S3D
    films into three categories: natively captured, 2D-3D converted and
    CGI. The section contains a lot of examples with converted shots in
    natively captured films and natively captured shots in converted S3D
    films.

Professional stereographers have contributed to the analysis by
providing valuable comments and general feedback.
