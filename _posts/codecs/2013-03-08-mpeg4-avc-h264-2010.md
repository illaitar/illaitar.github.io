<span id="Objectives_and_Testing_Rules"></span>

## Objectives and Testing Rules

### H.264 Codec Testing Objectives

The main goal of this report is the presentation of a comparative
evaluation of the quality of new H.264 codecs using objective measures
of assessment. The comparison was done using settings provided by the
developers of each codec.

The main task of the comparison is to analyze different H.264 encoders
for the task of transcoding video—e.g., compressing video for personal
use. Speed requirements are given for a sufficiently fast PC; fast
presets are analogous to real-time encoding for a typical home-use PC.

<span id="Testing_Rules"></span>

### Testing Rules

- The entire test set was divided into two primary types of applications.
These applications differ by resolution, bitrate and encoding speed
requirements:

    - Movies (bitrates of 500-2000 kbps)
    - High-definition television (“HDTV”; bitrates of 0.7-10 mbps)
- There are special presets and speed limitations for every type of
application:

    - Movies (speed requirements for 750 kbps 4CIF sequences):
    - Minimum 120 fps for "High Speed" preset (1 pass, no B-frames, 1
reference frame)
    - Minimum 80 fps for "Normal" preset)
    - Minimum 40 fps for "High Quality" preset
- HDTV (speed requirements for 3 mbps 1280x720 sequences):

    - Minimum 100 fps for "High Speed" preset (1 pass, no B-frames, 1
reference frame)
    - Minimum 50 fps for "Normal" preset
    - Minimum 20 fps for "High Quality" preset

- Each codec’s developer provided settings for each type of application.
- Each setting’s individual parameters were, to a large extent, chosen by
the developers, except the following:

    - DivX H.264
    - Microsoft Expression Encoder
    - Theora

- Each codec was tested for speed three times; the minimum score was then
used as the representative time.
- During the testing process, source video sequences were in the YV12
format (.yuv file extension) for all codecs except Theora (.y4m with
YV12)

- The following computer configuration was used for the main tests:

    - 4-cores processor: Intel Core i7 920, 2.67GHz
    - OS Name: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit
    - Total Physical Memory: 6 GB
    - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 275

- During the evaluation the following measures were used:

    - SSIM (Y components)
    - PSNR (Y components)

More detailed information about these measures may be found on the
Internet at the [Quality
Measure](/vqmt/info.html)
page.

<span id="Results_for_Movies"></span>

## Results for Movies

Full results for Movies could be found in professional versions of this
report:  
[H.264 Comparison Report Pro 2010 - Movie
edition](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2010.html#version_comparison)  
[H.264 Comparison Report Pro 2010 - Enterprise
edition](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2010.html#version_comparison)

This version contains only Y-SSIM results only for Normal preset. <span id="RD_Curves"></span>

### RD Curves

The Normal preset results for each sequence are presented in next
figures. The results do not depend strongly on the metric used. SSIM
metric: The leader is x264; MainConcept placed second, and DivX H.264
placed third. For the "Ice Age" and "Up" sequences, the MediaSDK and
Elecard encoders exhibited similar results. For the "Indiana Jones" and
"State Enemy" sequences, the XviD encoder placed fourth.

</div>

<span id="Encoding_Speed"></span>

### Encoding Speed

Absolute speed results are presented in next figures. All the encoders
except Microsoft Expression and Theora have a similar growth rate for
encoding time versus increasing bitrate. Elecard is the fastest encoder.
The encoding speed of the Microsoft Expression and Theora encoders
exhibits almost no dependency on bitrate, and Microsoft Expression’s
encoding speed decreases at 1,200 kbps for the “Ice Age” sequence.
XviD’s encoding speed exhibits little dependency on bitrate for the “Up”
sequence.

<span id="Speed_Quality_tradeoff"></span>

### Speed/Quality tradeoff

*Detailed descriptions of the speed/quality trade-off graphs can be found
in Appendix 7. Sometimes, codec results are not present in the
particular graph owing to the codec’s extremely poor performance. The
codec’s RD curve has no intersection with the reference’s RD curve.*

The speed/quality trade-off graphs simultaneously show relative quality
and encoding speed for the encoders tested in this comparison. XviD is
the reference codec, for which both quality and speed are normalized to
unity for all of the graphs. The terms “better” and “worse” are used to
compare codecs in the same manner as in previous portions of this
comparison.

*Please note that the method of averaging among all sequences assumes
that all codecs produced results for each sequence. When this is not the
case, only existing results are taken into account.*

Next figures show results for the Normal preset. The results differ
depending on the chosen metric.

Y-SSIM: The three best codecs (no codec performs faster with higher
quality) in terms of speed and quality are XviD, Elecard and x264 on
average, except for the "Ice Age" and "Indiana Jones" sequences. The
x264 encoder is better on average than DivX H.264 and MainConcept.

Almost all encoders except Microsoft Expression exhibited better results
on average than did Theora.

<span id="Bitrate_Handling"></span>

### Bitrate Handling

Encoders with Normal presets, except the Microsoft Expression encoder,
demonstrate good bitrate handling for all sequences. For the “Up”
sequence, XviD showed less than stellar results, especially at high
bitrates. For all sequences, MainConcept, x264, Elecard and DivX H.264
showed the best results compared with other encoders. DivX H.264’s
bitrate decreases at 1,500 kbps. MediaSDK slightly decreases bitrates,
but the results are stable. Theora has a good bitrate handling mechanism
but is not very stable.

<span id="Relative_Quality_Analysis"></span>

### Relative Quality Analysis

Next table shows relative bitrates for a fixed-quality output for all
codecs. Note that these tables do not include information about the
speed of the encoder.

Note that each number in the tables below corresponds to some range of
bitrates (see Appendix 7 for more details). Unfortunately, these ranges
can differ significantly because of differences in the quality of
compared encoders. This situation can lead to some inadequate results
when three or more codecs are compared. This comparison technique will
be improved in the future.

The leaders are x264 and MainConcept, depending on the quality metric
(the bitrate difference is 18% for a fixed quality).

that all codecs produced results for each sequence. When this is not the
case, only existing results are taken into account.

## Conclusions

<span id="Movies"></span>

### Movies

The leading encoders in this usage area are MainConcept and x264. The
quality of the Theora encoder is rather low.

**High Speed Preset**

The x264 encoder demonstrates better quality on average, and MainConcept
shows slightly lower quality. These codecs’ bitrate handling algorithm
is acceptable for this usage area. The MediaSDK codec places third,
along with the dicas encoder (MediaSDK has slightly higher quality, but
its encoding speed is 25% lower). The top four codecs for this preset
are the following:

1.  x264
2.  MainConcept
3.  MediaSDK

**Normal Preset**

The results for the Normal preset differ from those for the High Speed
presets only in third place. The x264 encoder demonstrates better
quality on average, and MainConcept shows slightly lower quality. The
DivX H.264 encoder holds third place. The top three codecs for this
preset are the following:

1.  x264
2.  MainConcept
3.  DivX H.264

**High Quality Preset**

The results for this preset are similar to those of the Normal preset.
The leaders are the x264 and MainConcept codecs. DivX H.264 takes third
place. The top three codecs for this preset are the following:

1.  x264
2.  MainConcept
3.  DivX H.264

</div>
</div>

_\*The encoding speed of these encoders is not in the requirements range
owing to our chosen presets or to a lack of options  
\*\*The MediaSDK encoder does not meet the requirements for High Speed
presets–specifically, no B-frames and exactly one reference frame_

<span id="HDTV"></span>

### HDTV

The leaders in the HDTV area are x264, DivX H.264 and MainConcept. The
XviD encoder trails all other H.264 encoders. Theora demonstrates rather
poor results compared with other encoders.

**High Speed Preset**

The x264 encoder demonstrates better quality on average, and MainConcept
shows slightly lower quality. The top three codecs for this preset are
the following:

1.  x264
2.  DivX H.264 (this preset does not meet speed requirements)
3.  MainConcept

**Normal Preset**

The results for the Normal preset differ from those of the High Speed
presets. MainConcept shows the best results. The difference between best
codecs are 2-4% of bitrate for the same quality. The top three codecs
for this preset are the following:

1.  MainConcept
2.  x264
3.  DivX H.264

**High Quality Preset**

The results for the High Quality preset are very interesting: x264 held
first place, MainConcept was in second place, and two codecs (DivX H.264
and Elecard) shared third place (their quality results are very close,
but DivX H.264 is 1.2 times faster than Elecard). The top four codecs
for this preset are the following

1.  x264
2.  MainConcept
3.  DivX H.264 and Elecard

owing to our chosen presets or to a lack of options  
\*\*The DivX H.264 High Speed preset for HDTV does not meet the speed
requirements_

<span id="Overall_Conclusions"></span>

### Overall Conclusions

Overall, the leader in this comparison is x264, followed by MainConcept
and DivX H.264. The Theora encoder demonstrates the worst results among
all codecs tested.

</div>
</div>

_\*The encoding speed of this codec does not fall in the required range
owing to our chosen presets or to a lack of options._

The overall ranking of the codecs tested in this comparison is as
follows:

1.  x264
2.  MainConcept
3.  DivX H.264
4.  MediaSDK
5.  Elecard
6.  XviD
7.  Theora

Microsoft Expression Encoder 3 could not be placed in this list because
of its much longer encoding time compared with other encoders (except
Theora).

Using the standard Theora interface, we could not find any
multithreading options; Theora works only in single-thread mode. The
leader in this comparison is x264—its quality difference (according to
the SSIM metric) could be explained by the special encoding option
("--tune ssim"). Interestingly, using the PSNR metric for MainConcept
yielded results comparable with or better than those of x264. This means
that no encoder can achieve the best results for both SSIM and PSNR when
using the same parameters.

The difference between the MainConcept and DivX H.264 encoders is not
overly significant, so these encoders tied for second in this
comparison. The developers of the Elecard encoder do not provide a High
Speed preset, so its ranking is based solely on the results for the
Normal and High Quality presets. The dicas encoder holds third or fourth
place for some sequences.

This rank is based only on the encoders’ quality results. Encoding speed
is not considered here.

<span id="Codec_Conclusion"></span>

## Codec Conclusion

**DivX H.264** — quite balanced encoder with not very big number of
parameters, this fact could be comfortable for users. This encoder is
designed as a free sample application for DivX Plus HD compliant video
encoding, and is a feature-constrained, for-purpose application.

**Elecard** — very fast codec with good encoding quality and very
flexible settings. Many adjustable encoding settings are provided. This
encoder has a very good bitrate handling mechanism (especially for the
“Movies” usage area).

**Microsoft Expression Encoder** — the low encoding speed could result
from the GUI loading every time a video is encoded. Unfortunately, we
could not automate the encoder to eliminate this GUI loading.

**MediaSDK** — balanced encoder with a limited number of parameters but
several use cases (speed/quality presets), making the encoder very
comfortable for users.

**MainConcept** — one of the best codecs by encoding quality; has many
encoding settings that can be adjusted. This encoder has a very good
bitrate handling mechanism.

**Theora** — not an H.264 codec. Using our testing methodology
(objective metrics) and test set, this encoder yields lower quality than
do H.264 codecs and even MPEG-4 ASP.

**x264** — one of the best codecs by encoding quality; has very
user-friendly predefined presets, as well as many adjustable encoding
settings.

**XviD** — an MPEG-4 ASP codec; its quality could be very close to or
even higher than that of some commercial H.264 standard implementations,
especially for encoding “Movie” sequences, but not for “HDTV” sequences.

## Codec Analysis and Tuning for Codec Developers and Codec Users

Computer Graphics and Multimedia Laboratory of Moscow State University:

- 8 years working in the area of video codec analysis and tuning using
objective quality metrics and subjective comparisons.

- 16 reports of video codec comparisons and analysis (H.264, MPEG-4
MPEG-2, decoders’ error recovery).

- Methods and algorithms for codec comparison and analysis development,
separate codec’s features and codec’s options analysis.

- We could perform next task for codec developers and codec users.

### Strong and Weak Points of Your Codec

- Deep encoder parts analysis (ME, RC on GOP, mode decision, etc).

- Weak and strong points for your encoder and complete information about
encoding quality on different content types.

- Encoding Quality improvement by the pre and post filtering (including
technologies licensing).

### Independent Codec Estimation Comparing to Other Codecs for Different Use-cases

- Comparative analysis of your encoder and other encoders.

- We have direct contact with many codec developers.

- You will know place of your encoder between other newest well-known
encoders (compare encoding quality, speed, bitrate handling, etc.).

### Encoder Features Implementation Optimality Analysis

We perform encoder features effectiveness (speed/quality trade-off)
analysis that could lead up to 30% increase in the speed/quality
characteristics of your codec. We can help you to tune your codec and
find best encoding parameters.
