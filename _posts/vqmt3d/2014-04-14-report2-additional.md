# MSU Graphics & Media Lab Report #2 on stereo films quality assessment

Graphics & Media Lab CMC of [Lomonosov Moscow State
University](http://www.msu.ru) has about 10 years' experience in
comprehensive analyzing of compressed video. In March 2013 Graphics &
Media Lab (in cooperation with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about))
has released its [first report](/stereo_quality/report1.html) on stereo
films quality assessment. This first report presented our evaluation
results and overall quality comparison of 5 stereo films.

After a very successful release of Avatar the interest to stereo 3D
films endures now a bad slump. Some people even think that the 3D is
dying and has no future. This decline of 3D demand has a serious
background: many movie goers experience headache and eyestrain while
watching a stereo film. The Lab decided to analyze the stereo films,
captured with stereoscopic camera systems and to investigate the
potential reasons of the irritating annoyance. The main examined
problems, discovered during the film analysis:

1.  excessive horizontal disparity
2.  vertical disparity
3.  color mismatch (see Image #1)
4.  sharpness mismatch

We've got a lot of positive comments from professional stereographers on
our first report and were encouraged to continue the work on stereo film
evaluation. We are planning to publish in the 2-nd half of 2013 another
three reports and invite the stereographers for cooperation.

Now we have a pleasure to share with the industry professionals our
[second report](/stereo_quality/report2.html) on
stereo film quality analysis, also including five 3D movies filmed in
stereo:

1.  Dolphin Tale
2.  Drive Angry
3.  The Three Musketeers
4.  Hugo
5.  Sanctum

In the overall comparison of the examined films we compare 3D movies
from the 1-st and 2-nd reports, altogether 10 films.

## Depth Budget

Take a look at the depth budget (see the Image #2): 3D films created in
1994 have a big depth budget; the movies from 2011-2012 years have a big
negative parallax. 'Hugo' has a lot of objects before the screen, on the
contrary, in 'The Three Musketeers' all objects are behind the screen.

## Vertical Disparity

It's noticeable that all the recent films ('Hugo', 'The Three
Musketeers', 'Pirates of the Caribbean') have a good vertical disparity.
It means, that the situation is getting more and more better with the
lapse of time (see the Images #3 and #4).

It's obvious, that the stereo quality depends also on the film budget,
namely on the 2D to S3D conversion budget. We have estimated the
relation between the film budget and existing artifacts
(see the images #4, #6 and #8).
But unfortunately these evaluations can't give an
accurate information, because we don't know the conversion budgets
(source of the film budgets is <http://www.imdb.com/>)

## Color Mismatch

According to the Images #5 and #6 the films 'Hugo', 'Three Musketeers'
and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' have the best color measures.

## Sharpness Mismatch

Image #7 shows a good trend of improvement in the last years: the films
'Hugo', 'Three Musketeers' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' have a minimal
sharpness mismatch measures in comparison with the other evaluated
movies.

A key motive of this report is to improve the stereo quality and
therefore to reduce eye- and headache. The Graphics & Media Lab hopes,
that a high 3D video quality would contribute to a continually
increasing number of people, leaving the modern theaters without
annoyance and with good impressions from the image quality and
storytelling. The [report is available](/stereo_quality/report2.html#download) to
all who may be concerned and interested in improving the quality of
stereoscopic content. The next reports on 3D quality will be published
in the near future on the
[website](/stereo_quality/reports/).
