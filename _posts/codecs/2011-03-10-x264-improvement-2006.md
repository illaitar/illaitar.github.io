# x264 Codec Improvement

* Project head: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin  
* Implementation: Alexey Noskov, Alexander Parshin,
Vladimir Popov  

## Introduction

x264 is an open source codec of standard MPEG4 AVC/H.264, developed by
programmers from all over the world. Nowadays, x264 is one of the best
codecs of its standard, what is verified by different comparisons.

## Improvement description

We decided to improve ABR rate control mode. In this mode codec tries to
compress a film with target average bitrate satisfying specified
restrictions of maximum frame bitrate and buffer size.

Accumulated during previous frames' compressions statistic is actively
used by codec to improve effectiveness of adaptive models. But there is
no statistical information on the first frames of the sequence. To solve
this problem, codec uses some predefined values or values defined by
user.

An analysis showed that these default values are more suitable to high
bitrates. Therefore unfounded quality increase appears on low bitrates,
that leads to deterioration of both quality of consequent frames and
average quality of a movie.

To eliminate this drawback, we measured PSNR on different test
sequences, and selected optimal values of these coefficients for
different bitrates.

Two coefficients were modified in our measurements:

-   start\_qp - start quant coefficient. It is used to calculate
    quantifier for first frames, when codec accumulated no statistics.
    Unfortunately, codec can't specify this coefficient for ABR mode
    from command line. So, we implemented this feature for testing.
-   ipratio - quant coefficient modifier for I-frames. To calculate
    quantifiers for I-frames, codec uses results of accumulated
    statistics for P-frames, divided by this coefficient. This
    coefficient may be specified from a command line, as follows:
    ipratio = &lt;number&gt;

These parameters are used only before encoding start, so, our
improvements are more significant for short sequences.

Following sequences were used for measurements:

-   bbc - standard test sequence
-   susi - standard test sequence
-   battle - fragment from a movie "Terminator-2"
-   matrix - fragment from a movie "Matrix"

Each sequence was compressed with bitrates 100, 225, 460, 938, 1340,
2340 kbps. For every bitrate coefficients were variated as follows:
start\_qp - from 24 to 48 with step 2, ipratio - from 0.50 to 1.50 with
step 0.25. That allowed us to select optimal values for each bitarte and
each sequence from the testing set. Range of parameters was selected to
cover all possible optimal values with good accuracy and in acceptable
time.

As you can see on graph, quality of compressed movie mostly depends on
start quant coefficient, and varying of I-frame modifier doesn't cause a
significant changes. So, it was decided to make changes only in start
quantifier selecting.

Accumulated statistic was approximated by a simple function, dependent
on specified bitrate, and calculated each time before compression
starts, that leads to increase in quality and decrease in size of a
movie.

To approximate experimental curve it was decided to use a power function
of following type:

where a, b and c - unknown coefficients. Selection of coefficients was
implemented using nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. After
optimization, function becomes:

## Results

After modifications codec’s work on low bitrates was improved. As a
test, we used number of sequences, which didn’t participated in
parameter selection. Most of them show that our modification outperform
original version at low bitrates and has same average quality at middle
and high bitrates. Sources of Febrary, 12, 2006 were used for this
testing. We used following codecs parameters:

    x264 --bitrate=<targer_bitrate> --fps=<fps> --me=umh --merange=32 --subme=6 --ref=16 
    --analyse=all --direct=spatial --pbratio=1.5 --bframes=3 --weightb -o <output_file> <input_file> <width>x<height>

Following graphs show results at some sequences. "Matrix" is a sequence
from our test set and "flower" sequence was not used for parameters
selection.
