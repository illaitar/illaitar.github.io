# Private Codec Comparison

Private codec comparison is one of the most popular analysis type that
we perform. It is comparative analysis of your encoder and other
encoders — you will know place of your encoder between other newest
well-known encoders (compare encoding quality, speed, bitrate handling,
etc.).

## Comparison Customization

Due to fact that comparision is done on different codecs, presets and
video sequences all the parameters could be customized.

<div class="center" style="text-align: center">
<table border="" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="7" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
	<tbody><tr>
		<th>Parameter</th>
		<th>Customization</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tr_header">Encoding presets</td>
		<td>We can analyze 1–20 of your encoder presets. 
			There are two possible ways of presets selection:
			<ul>
				<li>You can send us presets</li>
				<li>We can select presets by ourselves using special preset selction subsystem to use best 
				(in terms speed/quality trade-off) presets</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tr_header">Competitive codecs</td>
		<td>We could compare your codec almost with any codec.
			There are three	possible ways of codec-competitors addition:
			<ul>
				<li>We can add non-commercial encoders, such as x264, xvid, Theora, WebM(VP8)</li>
				<li>We can add codec that you send us (if you have purchased it)</li>
				<li>We can purchase codec for you and include it in comparison</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tr_header">Test set of video sequences</td>
		<td>We have representative test set of video sequences, but we can use your sequences.
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

## Comparison Editions

There are different editions of the comparison differing to each other
of report volume, analysis depth, number of presets, ecnoders and
sequences and scope of work. Three typical editions are:

-   **Light version** — the cheapest version without report and
    deep analysis
-   **Basic version** — version with report and analysis with low
    number of competitors and presets.
-   **Professional version** — version with report and deep
    analysis with many competitors and presets.

			<td>5 codecs: x264, WebM (VP8), XviD or your competitors</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td class="tr_header">Test sequences</td>
			<td>4 test sequences from last H.264 comparison</td>
			<td>8 test sequences from last H.264 comparison</td>
			<td>8 test sequences from last H.264 comparison or your test sequences</td>
		</tr>
		<tr><td class="tr_header">Deliverables:</td>

				<ul>
					<li>RD curves, Speed/Quality and bitrate handling charts (PNG, html viewer)</li>

				</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Report, similar to last public H.264 comparison full report (pdf, doc)</li>
					<li>Raw metric results (textual form)</li>
					<li>Test sequences (Raw YUV sequences)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Report, similar to last public H.264 comparison full report (pdf, doc)</li>
					<li>Raw metric results (textual form)</li>
					<li>Test sequences (Raw YUV sequences)</li>
					<li> All encoded streams (including competitors)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="tr_header" colspan="4">Intermediate variants are also available!</td>
		</tr>

</div>
    
Another option is presets alignment by speed. It is always reasonable to
compare prests with similar speed (or similar quality). We can select
presets of competitors using our framework to align their speed with
your presets' speed. Such alignment makes encoding quality comparison
more fruitful.
