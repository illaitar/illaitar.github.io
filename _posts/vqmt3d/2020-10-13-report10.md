## About the Report

This is the 10th Anniversary Report of the VQMT3D project. It contains a detailed analysis of **105** stereoscopic (S3D) movies. It has some significant differences from previous reports released by us.
* For the first time, the report contains overall charts of comparison of all movies by more than 10 metrics. Moreover, we show a new method for comparing films by presenting film ratings and highlighting the top in four different categories.
* This report is **absolutely free** and available without registration because it does not contain any copyright content.
* Our project received valuable support from professional stereographers. In total, we corresponded with about 100 stereographers, 32 of whom visibly contributed to our reports.

We are publishing this report almost four years after its creation due to several reasons. We've cooperated with multiple companies and organizations, but their support in recent years has dwindled to zero. Moreover, although several companies whose business depends heavily on the success of 3D movies promised to aid our efforts, these promises went unfulfilled. We're nevertheless happy to
finally present you with our 10th Anniversary Report.

## Report contents and diagram examples

Firstly, we present an overall comparison of the movies we evaluated. It includes charts depicting the average metric values relative to a movieâ€™s release date and budget, as well as charts illustrating metric-value distributions.

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/vqmt3d/report10/depth_vs_budget.png" alt="Overall diagram"><br>
        <i>An example diagram which compares the depth continuity metric value and budget for each movie. Higher values indicate more frequent and intense depth jump cuts throughout a film.</i>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/vqmt3d/report10/color_mismatch_barchart.png" alt="Bar chart diagram"><br>
        <i>Color-mismatch values represent the strength of color difference between two views of a stereoscopic frame. An example bar-chart which shows average color-mismatch for each movie.</i>
    </div>
</div>

In the next section we rate movies on the basis of our metrics for multiple categories. Different metrics correspond to different categories, as do low- versus high-budget movies and movies with distinct release years. We also present an overall technical-quality comparison that combines all the relevant results for the various quality metrics.

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/vqmt3d/report10/stereowindow_category.png" alt="Top 10 movies by stereo window placement comfort"><br>
        <i>An example overall movie rating with top 10 best movies in terms of stereo window placement comfort.</i>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/vqmt3d/report10/technical_category.png" alt="Top 10 technical quality movies"><br>
        <i>This example diagram shows the technical quality category of low-budget movies, which is based on average movie rating by each metric.</i>
    </div>
</div>

We sum up the ratings in the previous section by concisely listing movies by their total number of nominations.

The final part describes our plans for continuing this project.
