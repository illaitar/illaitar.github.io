      MSU Video Quality Measurement Tool (MSU VQMT) is professional software that is used to perform deep 
      comparative objective analysis of video quality. The main functionality of this software 
      is to calculate objective quality metrics for digital multimedia content (video or image) 
      using reference (when comparing one or several processed/compressed/distorted video sequences 
      to original one) or non-reference (when analyzing content and getting mark of its quality) 
      types of analysis.

      MSU VQMT is developed by [**COMPRESSION.RU Team**](https://compression.ru) with 
      participants **MSU Graphics & Media Lab. Video Group** (G&M Lab.). Project leader: 
      [dr. Dmitry Vatolin](dmitriy@graphics.cs.msu.ru).

      To use MSU VQMT with Python refer to [MSU VQMT Python Interface](https://github.com/msu-vqmt/vqmt-python).

   **Codec developers** Modern metrics are close to human perception. Control quality loss with VQMT.

   **Television industry**. Be sure in picture quality.

   **Studios**. Control quality in automatic or manual mode on stage of production

   **Medical equipment developers**. Analysis quality and parameters of medical devices signal.

   **Video providers**. Reduce storage and transmission cost.

   **Research groups & Universities**. Use VQMT to control arbitrary parameters of video and images.

   **Individuals**. Writers, bloggers, journalists in video segment.

   **AV system manufacturers**. For camera, video compressors, transmitters developers.

   We use MSU VQMT in own projects, for example:
   * Moscow State University, CS MSU Graphics & Media Lab. Annual Codecs Comparison
     [https://www.compression.ru/video/codec\_comparison/index\_en.html](https://www.compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/index_en.html).

   * MSU Benchmarks. [https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/](https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/)

- name: Editions & API
  content: |
   **FREE license** is an edition for individuals. It supplies only GUI edition for Windows and has 
   limitations.

   **DEMO license** is an edition for testing PRO/Premium features. This version is useless - computed values are 
   incorrect. However it can be used to test VQMT features and performance.

   **Trial license** is an edition for companies considering purchasing VQMT. This edition can be requested on 
   [VQMT website](https://compression.ru/vqmt). The standard trial period is 2 weeks.

   **PRO license** is an edition for companies and individuals, who wants to use all abilities of 
   MSU VQMT GUI and CLI interfaces on Windows or Linux. It helps them to carry out massive comparisons of 
   their technologies using batch processing of big numbers of files and flexible options for 
   measurements without technical limitations. One PRO verison license grants access to one Windows and 
   one Linux platform simultaneously. We have very attractive volume discounts.

   **PREMIUM license** is an edition for companies, who actively uses MSU VQMT.
   It doesn't limit installations, supports automatical activation, using in clouds, on virtual machines 
   and more.

   **SDK license** is a special expensive license for companies that want to incorporate VQMT into their workflow.

      Three types of User Interface:
      1. Command-Line Interface (Windows & Linux, Professional only);
      2. Graphic User Interface (Windows only, Free & Professional);
      3. Python Interface. Can be installed via [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/msu-vqmt/).

      Various input video formats:

      * Visualization;
      * Different averaging modes;
      * Plug-ins interface with SDK that gives user possibility to create their own metrics;
      * Possibility to compare several files in one comparison – typical situation when comparing original uncompressed file with several compressed files with different codecs or presets;
      * Possibility to save “bad” frames for every comparison with flexible options – it can be very useful when comparing two (or more) codecs and user wants to see frames where these codecs have maximum difference, the lowest/highest metric value, etc.
