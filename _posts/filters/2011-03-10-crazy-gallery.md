# Crazy gallery

* Project, idea: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin  
* Preparation, text: Nikolai Trunichkin

We obtained very interesting results while we were developing the
filters :) These results turned out to be quite interesting so we
decided to publish them. They were called: "Crazy gallery". Of course,
we will explain what the filter does and what is wrong with its
algorithm, because sometimes it is almost impossible to do even for
professional. So let's go...  
  
Look at the first picture, the merry-go-round spinned very fast and
Bitrate control algorithms cope with a task well.

        <img src="/assets/img/filters/crazy-gallery/rate_control2.jpg" alt="&quot;Roundabout&quot; - Algorithm BitRate control"><br>
        <i>"Roundabout" - Algorithm BitRate control</i>
    </div>
</div>
  
Look at this masterpiece! A picture named "Abstract painter palette" is
a result of author's laborious work. This picture owes its appearance to
a motion compensation error.

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/filters/crazy-gallery/motion_compensation.jpg" alt="&quot;Palette abstract painter&quot; - Error in motion compensation"><br>
        <i>"Palette abstract painter" - Error in motion compensation</i>
    </div>
</div>
  
We also have some exclusive samples :) The guest from other planets
allowed to photograph them, but asked not to reveal their origin.

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/filters/crazy-gallery/motion_compensation_brt.jpg" alt="&quot;Alien in town!!!&quot; - Error in brightness quantization"><br>
        <i>"Alien in town!!!" - Error in brightness quantization</i>
    </div>
</div>
  
A unique experiment was conducted which allowed us to see a man's aura.
It is a unique filter... You can also see ghosts with it :)

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/filters/crazy-gallery/motion_compensation_colors.jpg" alt="&quot;Our program may show aura!&quot; - Error accumulation in moving regions"><br>
        <i>"Our program may show aura!" - Error accumulation in moving regions</i>
    </div>
</div>
  
This fragment was taken from the susi.avi sequence. We all know that
Susi didn't drink but our alcohol detector program shows the opposite.

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/filters/crazy-gallery/susi.jpg" alt="&quot;Detector alcohol&quot; - Denoising result"><br>
        <i>"Detector alcohol" - Denoising result</i>
    </div>
</div>
  
The next filter could be used by the police because your face won't be
recognized even by your mama :)

<div class="center">
    <div>
        <img src="/assets/img/filters/crazy-gallery/gallery_foreman.jpg" alt="&quot;Operational photography&quot; - Frame Rate Conversation"><br>
        <i>"Operational photography" - Frame Rate Conversation</i>
    </div>
</div>
  
When we get a new result, we will show it to you.
