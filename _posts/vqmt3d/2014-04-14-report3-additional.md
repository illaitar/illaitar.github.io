# MSU Graphics & Media Lab Report #3 on stereo films quality assessment

Graphics & Media Lab CMC of [Lomonosov Moscow State
University](http://www.msu.ru) has about 10 years' experience in
comprehensive analyzing of compressed video. In March 2013 Graphics &
Media Lab (in cooperation with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about))
has already released [two reports](/stereo_quality/reports/)
on stereo films quality assessment since March 2013. In these reports we
presented our evaluation results and overall quality comparison of 10
stereo films altogether.

After a very successful release of Avatar the interest to stereo 3D
films endures now a bad slump. Some people even think that 3D is dying
and has no future. This decline of 3D demand has a serious background:
many movie goers experience headache and eyestrain while watching a
stereo film.

The Lab decided to analyze the stereo films and to investigate the
potential reasons of the irritating annoyance. The first two reports
were focused on films captured with stereoscopic camera systems, and the
main problems discovered during the film analysis were:

-   excessive horizontal disparity
-   vertical disparity
-   color mismatch
-   sharpness mismatch (Image #1)

We've received a lot of positive comments from professional
stereographers on these reports and were encouraged to continue the work
on stereo film evaluation.

> *In many cases flat scenes are simply victims of declining budgets.
Often times, companies will prioritize shots on the basis of length or
fast motion the idea being that if a shot is very short/fast, no one
will notice that it is 2D. For the most part, this approach is
acceptable to the viewing public because they simply don't notice or
don't care. One of the problems of intercutting 2D and 3D is the
cumulative result of the brain expecting something it doesn't get. Over
time, this mismatch in perception and expectation can result in a form
of motion sickness (similar to when the ears and eyes don't agree on
what they are perceiving).*

We are planning to publish three more reports in the 2nd half of 2013
and invite the stereographers for cooperation.
Also, we are working hard to present our analysis of a stereo-window
violation effect, which may be especially annoying in the more visible
parts of the image. This issue appears in both captured and converted
S3D films.

Now we would like to introduce our third report, in which we for the
first time evaluate converted S3D films. The report includes the
following converted S3D films:

-   Alice in Wonderland
-   Clash of the Titans
-   Conan the Barbarian
-   Green Lantern
-   Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter

2D-3D conversion introduces many new problems which are absent in
captured S3D video. In our third report in addition to the problems,
which were the focus of previous reports, we examine two common issues
of converted S3D films:

-   the cardboard effect (Image #2)
-   edge sharpness mismatch (Image #3)

In the overall comparison of the examined films we compare 15 S3D movies
altogether from all three reports.

## Depth Budget

The report also provides the depth budget chart for both converted S3D
films and captured ones (Image #4). It's clear from this chart that
'Green Lantern' has no objects in front of the screen, while 'Alice in
Wonderland' has.

## Vertical Disparity

It's also noticeable that converted S3D films generally have better
vertical alignment than captured S3D films (Image #5). In fact,
'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' has the best vertical alignment among
the processed films.

## Color mismatch

The same refers to color mismatch: the converted S3D films generally
have much better color alignment between the left and right stereoscopic
images (Image #6). However, color mismatch still appears in converted
S3D films and it turned out that color mismatch in 'Alice in Wonderland'
was stronger than in 'Clash of the Titans'.

## Comparison of 2D & S3D versions

The report also contains a comparison of 2D & S3D versions of all five
films. This research has several goals:

-   Analysis and classification of different 2D-3D conversion
    techniques;
-   Assessment of 2D-3D conversion quality from a slightly different
    perspective;
-   Development of 2D-3D conversion quality-control tools.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the following people for providing valuable
comments, opinions and feedback, which helped us to improve this report:

-   **Robert Black**, 3D R&D, 3D Consultant / Stereographer
-   **Ross Copeland**, Online Editor / Stereographer & Colourist, Post
    Production Consultant

A key motive of this report is to improve the stereo quality and
therefore to reduce eye- and headache. The Graphics & Media Lab hopes,
that a high 3D video quality would contribute to a continually
increasing number of people, leaving the modern theaters without
annoyance and with good impressions from the image quality and
storytelling. The [report is available](/stereo_quality/report3.html#download) to
all who may be concerned and interested in improving the quality of
stereoscopic content. The next reports on 3D quality will be published
in the near future on the [website](/stereo_quality/reports/).
