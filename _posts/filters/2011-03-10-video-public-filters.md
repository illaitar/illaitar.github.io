# Video filtering and compression by MSU Video Group

## MSU Public Access Video Filters

Below is the list of video processing filters (research VirtualDub
versions) developed in our lab. Commonly we are developing filter
families. Please contact us for ASIC/FPGA/DSP optimized versions.

-   **[Cartoon Restore filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/cartoon-restore.html)**  
    This filter improves compressed animated cartoons quality by
    removing ringing artifacts. Three methods with different
    complexities are implemented. Examples of work and all settings
    description can be found at the filter's page.
-   **[Noise Estimation filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/noise-estimation.html)**  
    The filter is used to estimate mean noise variance in video
    sequences. The result is saved into a log file.
-   **[Frame Rate Conversion filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/frame-rate-conversion.html)**  
    The filter is intended for video frame rate up-conversion. It
    increases the frame rate integer times. It allows, for example, to
    convert a video with 15 fps into a video with 30 fps.
-   **[Old Cinema filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/old-cinema.html)**  
    This filter adds some effects like noise, lines, color and some
    others... Use it to make movie look like old chronicle. You can see
    examples from very old movie "Terminator-2". ;) We took it from last
    century archives.
-   **[Deblocking - block removal filter for VideoCD movies
    (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/deblocking.html)**  
    Filter is intended for recovering quality of video ripped from DVD
    (for example, when it contains 4 hours of video data), VideoCD or
    after decompression by H.261, H.263, DivX 3, DivX 4, XviD.
-   **[Smart Brightness and Contrast (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/smart-contrast.html)**  
    The filter corrects image brightness and contrast without loss of
    bright and dark details and is much easier to use than respective
    Photoshop filter (see examples).
-   **[Noiser (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/noise-generation.html)**  
    The filter is intended to aid in debugging of denoising algorithms
    and for processing of rendered sequences to give them natural view.
-   **[Denoiser (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/denoising.html)**  
    Designed for noisy video stream processing to improve quality and/or
    ease further processing, such as compression.
-   **[Motion Estimation Information (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/motion-estimation.html)**  
    The filter is designed to aid in performance analysis and debugging
    of video codecs, development of denoising filters, scene complexity
    analysis, etc.
-   **[Smart Sharpen (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/smart-sharpen.html)**  
    As the name implies, the filter improves image sharpness.
-   **[Deflicker (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/deflicker.html)**  
    Filter to reduce flicking artifact on video captured from film or
    recorded with artificial flicking light.
-   **[MSU Subtitle Remover (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/subtitles-removal.html)**  
    The filter is intended to remove subtitles from films.
-   **[MSU Logo Remover (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/logo-removal.html)**  
    The filter is intended to remove logo from films.
-   **[AviSynth plug-in "MSU Field Shift Fixer" (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/old-film-recover-field-shift.html)**  
    The filter is intended to field shift on old film capturing. Written
    for AviSynth 2.0 or 2.5.
-   **[MSU StegoVideo filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/stego-video.html)**  
    Unique filter, allows to hide info in compressed video file with
    unknown codec.
-   **["MSU Cartoonizer Filter" filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/cartoonizer.html)**  
    The filter is designed for animated cartoon, watercolor and pencil
    drawing rendering. MSU Cartoonizer filter has many parameters which
    allow to get very interesting results. This is first filter by
    Graphics & Media Lab from non-photorealistic rendering area.
-   **[MSU Smart Deblocking filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/deblocking-smartdeblocking.html)**  
    Filter is intended for recovering quality of video ripped from DVD
    (for example, when it contains 8 hours of video data). In comparison
    with MSU Deblocking provide better quality for high compressed
    video.
-   **[MSU Old Color Restoration filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/old-color-restoration.html)**  
    Filter is used for restoring of faded colors in old video.
-   **[MSU Color Enhancement filter (description, examples,
    filter)](/video_filters/color-enhancement.html)**  
    Filter is used for saturation enhancing, shadowed details restoring,
    color images visual quality improving.
