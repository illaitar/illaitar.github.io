# MSU 3D Video Capture for glasses-free 3D displays

* Project: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin
* Implementation, algorithm: Sergey Grishin, Karen Simonyan, Sergey Matyunin

## Introduction

The technology of the 3D video creating has long history. Playback
equipment imperfections and the complexity of the creating
three-dimensional films always prevented the spread of the 3D video
technology. Scientists are near to the solution of the first problem:
they have already developed monitors which don't require neither special
glasses nor other extra devices for viewing. 3D video making still
requires expensive high-quality equipment and therefore it's almost
inaccessible for general users. our laboratory was challenged to make a
3d film using cheap widespread devices - web-cameras.

## Equipment

We used two web-cameras for the video capture and monitor Spatial View
19'' for camera tunning and video demonstration.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Autostereoscopic monitor</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Work description

The given display creates 3D effect using 5 views from different camera
points. We got two of them directly from the cameras and the rest views
were generated by [MSU Stereo To Multiview Conversion
method](/video_filters/stereo-to-multiview.html)
developed by our library. Similar video sequence was generated for
9-view monitor.

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Interpolation of the intermediate views</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Video from cameras have significant brightness/white balance difference.
It can cause conversion artefacts. So preprocessing is required.
Semiautomatic video-filter for the smoothing of the differences in the
color rendition between the cameras was developed.

## How to view 3D video

To view 3D images you need autostereoscopic monitor and specialized
player. Depending on how many views does your monitor support you should
download 5-view or 9-view video. View order is also important. You
should choose view order (from left to right OR from right to left)
supported by your player.

<table class="center" style="text-align: center" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
	<tbody><tr align="center">
		<td colspan="1">
			<b>5 view alignment:</b>
		</td>
		<td colspan="2">
			<b>9 view alignment:</b>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr align="center">
		<td><img src="/assets/img/vqmt3d/3d-video-capturing/3x3_5_left.png" alt="5 view alignment. From left to right."></td>
		<td><img src="/assets/img/vqmt3d/3d-video-capturing/3x3_9_left.png" alt="9 view alignment. From left to right."></td>
		<td><img src="/assets/img/vqmt3d/3d-video-capturing/3x3_9_right.png" alt="9 view alignment. From right to left."></td>
	</tr>
	<tr align="center">
        	<td>From left to right</td>
		<td>From left to right</td>
		<td>From right to left</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

Conversion output format can be also specified to be a sequence of
numbered views or other appropriate way.

## Results

As a result of the work the method of 3D video creating using
web-cameras was developed and two versions of demo video were created
(for 5-view and 9-view monitors). Video sequences are available for
download (See link below).

All videos encoded by XVID codec.

3D videos were generated by [MSU Stereo To Multiview
Conversion](/video_filters/stereo-to-multiview.html)
algorithm developed by our laboratory.
