# MSU Analysing and Tuning of Video Codecs

## Codec Analysis

One of the main tasks during codec's development and tuning is
evaluation of compressed video quality and measurements' data
management. We test and develop video codecs of different types and
standards for more than 5 years. Some of our publicly available codecs
comparison reports are located and can be **freely downloaded** from
[videocodecs
comparison](/codecs/comparisons.html)
webpage. We are making commercial projects on codecs' testing and tuning
and are interested in any possible projects in this area.

## x264 Parameters Analysis

x264 is a freeware codec of MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 standard. A number of codec
comparisons including [our
own](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2006.html)
show that x264 currently is one of the best H.264 codecs.

We made an analysis of x264 parameters. Results of performed analysis
clearly show usecases of different codec's parameters. These results may
be of interest to professional users of this codec and codec developers.
Also such results are of considerable help for codec's tuning and
improvement.

Comparison report [freely available at our
website](/codecs/x264-options-analysis-2008.html).

## Video Codecs Testing and Tuning Software

There is a common task to analyze a video codec to assess its quality,
quality of its functions. For example such a task appears when
developing a new codec or tuning an already developed one. Such tasks
commonly are solved by manual or semiautomatic testing systems and often
these systems have not a sufficient number of functions for complete
analysis.

### MSU Video Quality Metric Tool

Main task of MSU Video Quality Metric Tool (VQMT) is to compare video
sequences using objective quality metrics. Main features of proposed
system are:

-   Support of most popular file formats: AVI, YUV, MOV, MP4,...
-   Support of many popular video quality metrics: PSNR, MSE, SSIM, VQM,
    ...
-   Graphic user and command-line interfaces
-   Plug-ins support

There are two versions of VQMT: free version for personal usage (reduced
functionality) and commertional version for companies (all features are
included). See [VQMT
page](/vqmt/vqmt.html)
for more information.

### Video Codecs Scoring System

Main tasks of Video Codecs Scoring System (ViCoS) are analysis of video
codecs performance based on objective video quality metrics.

Main methods of analysis are:

-   Compare codecs based on Rate-Distortion curves for several sequences
-   Natural sequences modiffications usage
-   Synthetic sequences usage
-   Codecs's presets automatic analysis and selection

Main features of the ViCoS System are the following:

-   Easy massive codecs launches using CLI
-   Possibility of massive paralles launches using client-server
    archtecture
-   Support of relational data bases
-   MATLAB visualization toolbox
