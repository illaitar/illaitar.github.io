# MSU Videogroup Filters Frequently Asked Questions

## Frequently Asked Questions

-   **Q: Why public access is not provided for some of the filters?**  
      
    A: There're two main reasons:
    -   Some company might have bought the filter and has exclusive
        rights on it. In this case it is mentioned on the page.
    -   The filter status might be still uncertain (in other words
        negotiations with some company about this filter are still in
        progress).

    To clear everything up we must say that our research laboratory is
    not typical. A lot of universities have similar multimedia
    laboratories but none of them provide public access for their
    filters.  
    Like many other labs we perform research in video processing scope.
    Some of our production is being sold to different commercial
    companies, some remains our property. Such filters are transformed
    into usable versions and put to public access.
-   **Q: Why don't other laboratories distribute their filters for free
    as well?**  
      
    A: Along with commercial reasons there may be unwillingness to spend
    time on free versions ;). Actually it's not that easy to get a final
    working version of the filter from the research one, which might
    fail on some input data or have very complicated options clear only
    to its creator. This task requires time so appreciate our doing it!
-   **Q: Many of your filters are rather slow. Could I expect faster
    versions in future?**  
    A: Sure you can! Despite the fact that commercial projects and
    promising researches are more important to our laboratory than
    optimization of the existing filters, we regularly release faster
    versions of our free filters. As a proof, two old filters recently
    have been made 10 times faster and soon will be available to public
    access.  
    It's no use to blame us for making slow filters because it only
    decreases the optimization process priority.  
    If we have a choice whether to share a current slow version of the
    filter or to wait (sometimes more than a year) till someone finds
    time to optimize it we choose the first alternative because usually
    the filter already provides enough quality to be used in cases where
    speed is less important.
-   **Q: Have you thought about selling your filters. I would pay! There
    would be money for its optimization!**  
      
    A: Funny that such questions come most often from Russians although
    our foreign audience is bigger. Actually we do sell them but
    wholesale way only. In retail quantities we provide them for free :)
-   **Q: Do you need feedback (some comments, bug reports,
    requests)?**  
      
    A: **SURE! :)** Many bugs that you find can be fixed in ten minutes
    (if we know, how exactly to reproduce this bug). And we do it of
    course.  
    You requests are collected as well and can be taken into account in
    future.
-   **Q: May I help you somehow if I want to get some filter?**  
      
    A: Sometimes you may. If you happened to need the same filter that
    we are working currently on we can cooperate. We could send you the
    current version of our filter for you to test its performance,
    report about results, problems or bugs discovered. We even can
    change the filter a bit to make it work better on some specific data
    of the person who helps us. We always appreciate real help and try
    to help in return.  
      
    This answer applies to filters, that are currently work in progress.
    Regarding written and announced filters see answer number 1.
-   **Q: How to find out what filter you're currently working on? I'd
    test it with pleasure!**  
      
    A: We've already thought about informing people about our current
    work because such requests aren't rare. Soon this information will
    be available at our forum. E-mail us until then!
