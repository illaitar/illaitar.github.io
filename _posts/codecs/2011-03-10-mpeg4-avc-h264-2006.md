# Third Annual MSU MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 Video Codec Comparison

  

### For people, who make real research in field of high-end video compression and professionally use videocodecs



See [NEW VERSION on Fourth Annual H.264/AVC comparison
page!](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2007.html)

* Project head: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin  
* Testing, charts, analysis: Dmitriy Kulikov, Alexander Parshin  
* Translating: Artem Titarenko  
* Verification: Dr. Maxim Smirnov  

### Codecs that Were Tested

- DivX 6.2.5 (Is not H.264 codec, was taken only as reference)
- MainConcept H.264
- Intel H.264
- VSS H.264
- x264
- Apple H.264 (partial tested)
- Sorenson H.264 (partial tested)

### Comparison Content

There are two parts of the comparison - 2006 year results and over-years
comparison. First part is comparison of modern codecs, provided by
developers in this year. Second part is summarizing of H.264 codecs
results over three previous years.

Following metrics were measured:
- PSNR (Y, U, V components)
- SSIM (Y component)
- VQM (Y component)

  

Codecs were analyzed separately in the following types of application:
- "Videoconferences"
- "Movies"
- "HDTV"

Individual codecs' settings were used for each of that types of
application.  

Video sequences that were used in this comparison:
- "foreman" (standard sequence)
- "akiyo" (standard sequence)
- "carphone" (standard sequence)
- "battle” (part from "Terminator-2" movie)
- "rancho" (part from "Terminator-2" movie)
- "matrix" (part from "The Matrix" movie)
- "futurama" (part from "Futurama" cartoon)
- "concert" (part of HDTV translation)

  

### Different Comparion Versions

<span id="full_version_description"></span>Short version of report is
now available at website for free download (52 pages, 47 figures). Full
version of report now available for free download too (157 pages, 185
charts). It includes following additional topics:
- SSIM RD curves individually for each sequence from all sequences
- All codecs presets
- Differences between PSNR and SSIM results
- Absolute encoding speed charts
- Relative Bitrate/Relative Speed graphs individually for each sequence
from test set
- Relative bitrate for the same quality for all pairs of codecs
- Bitrate handling graphs
- Per-frame quality and dispersion graphs
- Additional results for Apple and Sorenson codecs
- More detailed testing results for DivX 6.2.5 codec (most presets of this
codec)
- All sequences, used in this comparison are provided with full version of
report.

### Comparison Rules

**All codec’s options and presets were provided by codec’s authors**

An important restriction on a preset is encoding time for it. A few
iterations of compliance testing and preset optimization were made to
meet the requirements.

JM 9.8 reference decoder was used to decode all encoded streams.

All objective metrics measurements were performed with [MSU Video
Quality Measurement Tool (Pro
Version)](/vqmt/vqmt.html)

For each preset both speed and quality were measured

Dear video codec professionals!  
You can support this comparison by buying [the full version of our
report](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2006.html#full_version_description).  

This contribution will help us:
- To continue this comparison without any participation fees (this is
important for x264 and XviD AVC next year)
- To avoid comparison sponsorship by codecs' developers
- To keep comparison detailed and useful

Thank you for your contribution in advance!

The full report will be available immediately following [this
