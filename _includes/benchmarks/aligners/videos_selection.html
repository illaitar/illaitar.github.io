  <p>Content diversity in test sequences is necessary for running algorithms in near-realistic conditions. To provide this diversity the following steps have been undertaken.</p>
  <p>We identified two families of cases: processes during which temporary distortions could occur, i.e. video editing, streaming, capturing from different rigidly-connected cameras etc., and content in test videos which is difficult to align, i.e. talking head, recurring events (such as football matches, formula-1 racing), camera on a tripod (small amount of movement) etc. Then, we collected ~2000 videos from Vimeo from each taxonomic category to ensure unbiased video selection and sufficient coverage in terms of semantics and context presented in the video.</p>

<p> Finally, SI/TI features were calculated for each video and for each class we mapped videos to use cases mentioned above.</p>

<p> We chose videos that sufficiently cover SI/TI space and all the identified use cases and got 56 source videos.</p>
