# MSU Graphics & Media Lab Report #6 on stereo films quality assessment

One of the common issues with stereo 3D (S3D) movies is the presence of
stereo-window violations. A stereo-window violation can be defined as a
contradiction between two different depth cues where an object on the
side of the image is partly hidden by a border of the frame but, owing
to its parallax, appears closer than the border (Image #1). As with
other contradictions, this situation can cause serious discomfort
because it almost never occurs under viewing conditions in a real
environment. However, it often receives surprisingly little attention
during both production and screening of S3D movies. The Graphics & Media
Lab CMC of [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://www.msu.ru)
decided to investigate this problem.

In most cases the stereo-window violation issue can be fixed by means of
the floating-window technique. A floating window is simply a black
stripe added to the edge of one of the views to cover window-violating
content (Image #2). A lot of different strategies can be employed in
using this technique, including static, dynamic, slant or even curved
floating windows (Images #3-5)

The [sixth report](/stereo_quality/report6.html) is
dedicated to the analysis of stereo-window violation issue and use of
floating windows in various S3D movies. It addresses 10 different S3D
films, both natively captured and post-converted:

-   The Amazing Spiderman
-   The Three Musketeers
-   Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
-   Dolphin Tale
-   Drive Angry
-   The Avengers
-   John Carter
-   G-Force
-   Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
-   Clash of the Titans

The report presents per-frame charts that enable the analysis of
floating window behaviour with respect to disparity of the closest
object near the edge of the frame (Image #6). The charts are
accompanied by visualizations of the most noticeable window violations.

The report also presents an overall comparison of films in terms of
quality of stereo window violation handling.

One may notice that more recent movies tend to have better stereo-window
violation handling (Image #7)

Naturally, films with heavy use of floating windows tend to have less
stereo-window violations. However, some films achieve low stereo-window
violation number with virtually no floating windows across the whole
film (Image #8)

Image #8: Stereo Window Violation vs. Floating Window Usage Intensity

This fact can be explained by looking at the average disparities of the
closest object near the edge of the screen (Image #9). In fact, The
Three Musketeers has the highest average positive disparity value,
indicating that, indeed, floating windows are not required to achieve
low stereo window violation level in this film.

A key motive of our reports is to improve the stereo quality and
therefore to reduce eyestrain and headache. The Graphics & Media Lab
hopes that a high 3D video quality would contribute to a continually
increasing number of people, leaving the modern theaters without
annoyance and with good impressions from the image quality and
storytelling.

We are always interested in feedback from professionals in
film-production industry. We have already collaborated with more than 20
stereographers who provided us valuable comments which were inserted in
our reports. If you would like to participate in the next reports,
please feel free to contact us: <3dmovietest@graphics.cs.msu.ru>.
