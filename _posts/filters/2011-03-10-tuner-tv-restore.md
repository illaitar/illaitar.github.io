# VirtualDub MSU Tuner TV Restore Filter

**This filter was designed for TV signal restoration: denoising, from
poor signal or from signal with mirror ghosts.**

Filter restore:

- whole noise on the frame
- color spots artifacts (t.e. "very ugly", look at shirt)
- moire artifacts (see "jacket", "hair" below)
- "double" (ghosts images) artifacts - partly
- artifacts after deinterlacing - partly

## Examples

Let's consider job of the filter on a test sequence "News"
