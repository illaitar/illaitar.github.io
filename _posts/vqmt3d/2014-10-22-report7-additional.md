# MSU Graphics & Media Lab Report #7 on stereo films quality assessment

The stereo 3D (S3D) film industry is stagnating. And one of the major
factors behind it is the eyestrain and headaches commonly experienced by
the viewers due to poor quality of produced S3D content. The Graphics &
Media Lab CMC of [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://www.msu.ru)
(further: the Lab) has already published [6
reports](/stereo_quality/reports/) since March 2013
investigating this problem and assessing technical quality of various
S3D films.

The 1, 2, 4 reports were focused on films captured with stereoscopic
camera systems, and the main problems discovered during the film
analysis were:

-   excessive horizontal disparity
-   vertical disparity
-   color mismatch
-   sharpness mismatch

Third and fifth reports were dedicated to quality analysis of 2D-3D
conversion which introduces a lot of new problems that are absent in
captured S3D video. The analysis included the following common converted
S3D video issues:

-   the cardboard effect
-   edge-sharpness mismatch

The sixth report introduced the comprehensive analysis of the
stereo-window violation issue (Image \#1) and the use of floating
windows in stereoscopic films both from technical and creative
perspectives. This problem often receives very little attention, while
addressing it is crucial for delivering high-quality S3D content. It can
greatly benefit from careful planning of the shooting and it is another
factor that contributes to the overall importance of proper
pre-production in stereoscopy.

And now we would like to introduce the [seventh report](/stereo_quality/report7.html), where we continue
to investigate different strategies for dealing with stereo-window
violations and use of floating windows as a creative tool (Image \#2).
The report includes the following films:

-   Pina
-   Step Up Revolution
-   Resident Evil: Retribution
-   Hugo
-   A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas
-   Immortals
-   Green Lantern
-   Conan the Barbarian
-   Wrath of the Titans
-   Alice in Wonderland

The report presents per-frame charts that enable the analysis of
floating window behaviour with respect to disparity of the closest
object near the edge of the frame (Image \#2). The charts are
accompanied by visualizations of the most noticeable window violations.

dynamic positive-parallax floating windows in Pina. Such floating
windows are usually used to further enhance the perception of depth in a
scene.

The overall comparison of films now includes all 20 films analyzed in
sixth and seventh reports.

Image \#4: Stereo Window Violation vs. Floating Window Usage Intensity

Films with intense floating-window use generally have less prominent
stereo-window violations. Several movies, however, achieved low number
of noticeable stereo-window violations without using floating windows,
which means that some alternative techniques were used. The most common
approaches include: intentional darkening shot’s edges which can lessen
the negative effect of stereo-window violations, shifting the overall
parallax range of the film towards positive values and careful
pre-production to minimize the number of shots where negative-parallax
objects appear near the sides of the screen.

Image \#5: Stereo Window Violation vs. Closest Object Disparity

Movies like The Three Musketeers, Green Lantern and Wrath of the Titans
have a lot fewer objects in negative parallax near the edges of the
screen, that led to good stereo-window-violation handling quality
without using floating windows.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the following people for providing valuable
comments, opinions and feedback, which helped to improve this report:

-   **Marcus Alexander**, Stereoscopic Designer, 3D Producer
-   **Olivier Cahen**, Stereoscopic Consultant, Author
-   **Ross Copeland**, Online Editor / Stereographer & Colourist,
    Post-Production Consultant
-   **Markus Lanxinger**, Stereographer, Stereoscopic Supervisor

    Supervisor
-   **Fabien Remblier**, S3D and 4K Director, Stereographer, Producer

-   **Thomas Villepoux**, Director, Stereographer

A key motive of our reports is to improve the stereo quality and
therefore to reduce eyestrain and headache. The Graphics & Media Lab
hopes that a high 3D video quality would contribute to a continually
increasing number of people, leaving the modern theaters without
annoyance and with good impressions from the image quality and
storytelling.

We are always interested in feedback from professionals in
film-production industry. We have already collaborated with more than 20
stereographers who provided us valuable comments which were inserted in
our reports. If you would like to participate in the next reports,
