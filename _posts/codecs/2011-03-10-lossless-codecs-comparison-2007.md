## Comparison Content

The main goal of the performed comparison is getting answers on the
following questions regarding lossless video codecs:

- What codec or codecs are best for video capture and video editing
applications?
- What codec or codecs achieve the best compression ratio?
- What advantages multithreading gives to modern codecs supporting it?

Only absolutely lossless codecs were examined in this comparison. Only
progressive test video sequences were used.

**Main conclusions:**

- In Video Capture and Video Editing Area the overall clear winner is
Lagarith.
- In Maximum Compression area the overall winner is YULS.
- The most balanced and flexible codec is FFV1: relatively good speed and
high compression for various presets.

The comparison paper is 130 pages long and contains a lot of graphs to
facilitate analysis like this one:
