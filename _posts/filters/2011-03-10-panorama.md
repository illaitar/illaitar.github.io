# MSU Panorama (Mosaicing) filter

* Algorithm: Dmritriy Vatolin, Stas Soldatov, Konstantin Strelnikov  
* Implementation: Konstantin Strelnikov

The MSU Panorama Filter produces a complete panorama based on the movie
scenes. The filter is based on motion vectors. Its output exceeds 30fps,
which is a very good result.

MSU Panorama has two processing modes:

- *mode 1* - every frame is completely displayed in the panorama;
- *mode 2* - only previously undefined areas of the panorama are
  filled.

Here are some examples of the filter performance in these two modes.

## Examples

The pictures below demonstrate panorama production from two movies using
both modes.
