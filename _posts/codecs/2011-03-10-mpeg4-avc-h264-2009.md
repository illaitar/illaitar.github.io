# Fifth MSU MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 Video Codec Comparison  

**For people, who make real research in field of high-end video compression and professionally use videocodecs**

* Project head: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin  
* Testing, charts, analysis: Dmitriy Kulikov, Alexander Parshin  

[**DOWNLOAD**](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2009.html#download)

## Codecs that Were Tested
- Dicas H.264
- Elecard H.264
- Intel IPP H.264
- MainConcept H.264
- x264
- XviD (MPEG-4 ASP codec)

## Comparison Rules

**All codec options and presets were provided by codec authors.**

- An important restriction on a preset is encoding time for it. A few
iterations of compliance testing and preset optimization were made to
meet the requirements.

- Provided decoders or JM 9.8 reference decoder were used to decode all
encoded streams.

- All objective metrics measurements were performed with  
[MSU Video Quality Measurement Tool (Pro
Version)](/vqmt/vqmt.html).

- For each preset both speed and quality were measured.

### Comparison Content

Following metrics were measured:
- PSNR (Y component)
- SSIM (Y component)

Codecs were analyzed separately in the following types of application:
- "Video Conferences"
- "Movies"
- "HDTV"

Individual codecs' settings were used for each of usage areas.  

Video sequences that were used in this comparison:
- "Akiyo" (standard sequence)
- "Foreman" (standard sequence)
- "Paris" (standard sequence)
- "Stefan" (standard sequence)
- "Indiana Jones" (part of "Indiana Jones" movie)
- "Battle" (part of "Terminator-2" movie)
- "State Enemy" (part of "Enemy of the State" movie)
- "Wendys" (uncompressed progressive)
- "Mobile Calendar" (uncompressed progressive)
- "Pedestrian Area" (uncompressed progressive)
- "Stockholm" (uncompressed progressive)
- "Troy" (part of "Troy" HDTV movie)
