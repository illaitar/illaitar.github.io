# VQMT3D Project: Report 7 on 3D-video Quality Analysis

* Projects, ideas: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin
* Implementation: Alexander Bokov, Alexey Fedorov, Alexey Shalpegin, Alexander Novikov, Alexander Belous, Vladimir Yanushkovsky, Vyacheslav Napadovsky, Denis Sumin, Marat Arsaev, Alexander Voronov

In cooperation with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about)

## About the Report

The seventh report is dedicated to the analysis of stereo-window
violation issue and use of floating windows in various S3D movies. The
report presents detailed (**333** pages) evaluation results of 10 S3D
films, which were natively captured or post-converted.

The report comprises three main parts:

1.  We thoroughly describe the stereo-window violation effect and how it
    can be fixed using a floating-window technique. Next we provide a
    brief explanation of how to understand charts and visualizations in
    this report.
2.  We offer a detailed analysis of 10 films. This analysis comprises
    per-frame charts showing floating-window and closest-object
    disparities for both the left and right borders of the screen.
    Visualizations of frames with the most noticeable stereo-window
    violations are provided under the corresponding charts.
3.  The report concludes with an overall film comparison. Here, we show
    charts depicting the noticeability of stereo-window violations and
    the intensity of floating-window use for each film.
