## Main goals of the MPEG-4 SP/ASP testing

The main idea is to compare the results provided by the newest versions
of MPEG-4 codecs when they are used by an ordinary user for home video
compression. As a rule, such users prefer simple and popular programs to
play DVD movies or digitize signal from tuner. Also they rarely change
codec's default settings. So used default codecs settings in our
comparison varying only the bitrate value.

Another goal of this testing was to trace the evolution of the DivX
codec. Three versions of this codec took part in the testing: DivX 5.2.1, DivX 4.12, DivX 3.22.

The testing also illustrates the usage of two additional options in DivX 5.2.1: GMC
(Global Motion Compensation) and Quarter Pixel, that were
announced to improve quality on some video sequences.

Main parts of the comparison:

1.  Comparison in Y-PSNR, U-PSNR and V-PSNR metrics.
2.  Per frame comparison.
3.  Bitrate handling (does your movie fit on the CD?).
4.  Visual comparison.
5.  Informal codecs comparison.

## Comparison with PSNR metric

PSNR - is a metric used to compare two pictures: the more per pixel
difference between the pictures is the less is PSNR value. We use the
logarithm of the average value of the per frame PSNR metric to compare
two sequences. So the higher is the codec's line on the graph the better
is the quality of compression performed by this codec. Y-PSNR is the
difference in brightness component, U-PSNR and V-PSNR are the
differences in hue components.

The diagram below clearly demonstrates the advantage of DivX 5.2.1 over XviD 1.0.3.

## Visual codec comparison

In most cases the PSNR value is in accordance with the compression
quality. But sometimes this metric does not reflect presence of some
important visual artefacts. For example, we cannot estimate the quality
of the blocking artefacts compensation performed by some codec or detect
the presence of the "snow" artefacts (strong flicking of the stand-alone
pixels) in the compressed video using only PSNR metric. Also in some
cases it is difficult to say whether 2 dB difference is significant or
not.

That is why we use visual comparison of some frames in addition to the
PSNR graphics. This will not help us to understand the whole situation,
but will allow to demonstrate some interesting features of the codec
(e.g. block artifacts compensation).

</div>

These pictures present the same frame compressed by two different codecs
with the same bitrate. One can see that the frame from the sequence
compressed by XviD 1.0.3 has much better quality.

## Informal codecs comparison

Different codecs show significantly different results on different
sequences. That happens because of all represented sequences have
different character (motion, noise e.t.c.). This fact allows to define
which codecs do well with any kind of video sequences and which provide
good results only for some class of sequences. But all the diagrams do
not answer the question whether there is a leader among these codecs
which could be used for compression of most types of video. In order to
find out general characteristics of each codec on the whole testing set
we give different scores to the codecs according to some special rules
and place the results in a table. The more scores some codec gets the
better it is.
