# Fourth Annual MSU MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 Video Codec Comparison

**For people, who make real research in field of high-end video compression and professionally use videocodecs**

* Project head: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin  
* Testing, charts, analysis: Dmitriy Kulikov, Alexander Parshin  

[**DOWNLOAD**](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2007.html#download)

## Codecs that Were Tested
- XviD (MPEG-4 ASP codec)
- MainConcept H.264
- Intel H.264
- x264
- AMD H.264
- Artemis H.264

## Comparison Rules

**All codec options and presets were provided by codec authors**

An important restriction on a preset is encoding time for it. A few
iterations of compliance testing and preset optimization were made to
meet the requirements.

JM 9.8 reference decoder was used to decode all encoded streams.

All objective metrics measurements were performed with [MSU Video
Quality Measurement Tool (Pro
Version)](/vqmt/vqmt.html)

For each preset both speed and quality were measured

## Comparison Content

Following metrics were measured:
- PSNR (Y component)
- SSIM (Y component)

Codecs were analyzed separately in the following types of application:
- "Video Conferences"
- "Movies"
- "HDTV"

Individual codecs' settings were used for each of those application
types.  

Video sequences that were used in this comparison:
- "Salesman" (standard sequence)
- "Foreman" (standard sequence)
- "News" (standard sequence)
- "Battle" (part of "Terminator-2" movie)
- "Smith" (part of "Mr. and Mrs. Smith")
- "Iceage" (part of "Ice Age")
- "lord of the rings" (part of "Lord of the Rings")
- "Troy" (part of "Troy" HDTV movie)
- "Matrix" (part of "The matrix" HDTV movie)
