# VirtualDub MSU Old Film Restoration

The filter is intended to recover old film by removing vertical
scratches, noise, tape defects and other artifacts that can be found in
old cinema.  
  
By our measurements the compression ratio of DivX compressed movie after
this filter usage increases up to 3 times with better visual quality!

## Examples

Let's consider job of the filter on a test sequence "4msu".

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="/assets/img/filters/old-film-recover/4msu03_before.jpg" alt="Frame from film" /><br />
source frame from film 4msu03</td>
<td><img src="/assets/img/filters/old-film-recover/4msu03_after.jpg" alt="after Filter" /><br />
after filter works (please see how cockpit was recovered!)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="/assets/img/filters/old-film-recover/4msu05_before.jpg" alt="Frame from film" /><br />
source frame from film 4msu05</td>
<td><img src="/assets/img/filters/old-film-recover/4msu05_after.jpg" alt="after Filter" /><br />
after filter works</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="/assets/img/filters/old-film-recover/4msu11_before.jpg" alt="Frame from film" /><br />
source frame from film 4msu11</td>
<td><img src="/assets/img/filters/old-film-recover/4msu11_after.jpg" alt="after Filter" /><br />
after filter works</td>
</tr>
