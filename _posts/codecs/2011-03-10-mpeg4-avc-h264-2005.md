# Second Annual MSU MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 Video Codec Comparison

## For people, who make real research in field of high-end video compression and professionally use videocodecs

* Project head: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin  
* Testing, charts, analysis: Dmitriy Kulikov, Alexander Parshin  
* Translation: Artem Titarenko  
* Verification: Stanislav Soldatov  

**See** [NEW VERSION on Fourth Annual H.264/AVC comparison
page!](/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2007.html)

codecs

## Codecs that were tested

- DivX 6.0 (Not H.264 video codec, tested as reference codec)
- ArcSoft H.264
- Ateme H.264
- ATI H.264
- Elecard H.264
- Fraunhofer IIS H.264
- VSS H.264
- x264

## Comparison content

- During testing following metrics were measured:
    - PSNR (Y, U, V, L, R, G, B components)
    - SSIM (Y component)
    - VQM (Y component)
    - Blurring (Y, U, V components)
    - Blocking (Y, U, V components)

- Two codec presets will be compared:
    - “Maximum quality”
    - “Balanced” (speed)

- Video sequences that were used in this comparison
    - “foreman” (standard sequence)
    - “susi” (standard sequence)
    - “BBC” (standard sequence)
    - “battle” (part from "Terminator-2" movie)
    - “simpsons” (part from "The Simpsons" movie)
    - “Matrix” (part from "The Matrix" movie)
    - “Concert” (part from HDTV movie)

  

- Testing rules:
    - Restrictions of codecs’ operation: only codecs that can work in Main
    profile of H.264 and do not use two passes were tested.
    - Every codec was tested three times with separate speed measurements.
    After this median of these three values (middle value) was used as a
    resulting time.
    - Following 10 bitrates were used for codec testing (Kbps): 100, 225, 340,
    460, 700, 938, 1140, 1340, 1840, 2340.
    - During testing three types of video sequences were used:
        - Source sequences \*.yuv in YUV 4:2:0 format.
        - \*.avi sequences in YUV 4:2:0 format with fourcc “YV12”.
        - \*.yuv sequences with duplicated last frame. These sequences were used
        for testing x264 codec.
    - In this testing VirtualDub version 1.6.10 was used.
    - In this testing AviSynth version 2.55 was used.
    - For all metrics’ measurements in this test special build of [MSU Video
    Quality Measurement
    Tool](/vqmt/vqmt.html)
    was used.
    - For each preset both speed and quality were measured

## Comparison statistis

- Total number of graphs in this comparison is 3796. Only 82 (2%) of them
are in document;
- The number of computer-days is more than 20;
- Final document has 85 pages.
