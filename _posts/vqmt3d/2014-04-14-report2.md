# VQMT3D Project: Report 2 on 3D-video Quality Analysis

* Projects, ideas: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin
* Implementation: Alexander Voronov, Denis Sumin, Marat Arsaev, Vyacheslav Napadovsky, Alexander Belous, Vladimir Yanushkovsky

In cooperation with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about)

## About the Report

The report presents detailed (**342** pages) evaluation results of 5 S3D
films, which were captured with stereoscopic camera systems.

The report comprises three main parts.

1.  Thorough description of visual-discomfort potential causes while
    viewing stereo 3D films (see
    [page from report](/assets/img/vqmt3d/report2/report2_screen_1.png))
2.  Detailed analysis of five films. Each film description consists of
    two parts:
    -   **Full per-frame** analysis with charts showing metric values
        for each frame;
        (see [page from report](/assets/img/vqmt3d/report2/report2_screen_2.png))
    -   Visualizations demonstrating artifacts in frames that earned a
        poor rating according to our metrics
        (see [page from report](/assets/img/vqmt3d/report2/report2_screen_3.png)).  
        Please, see example visualizations at the
        [VQMT3D project page](/stereo_quality/#visualizations).
3.  Overall film comparison. Here go charts depicting the average metric
    values and distribution of these values in each film.
    (see [page from report](/assets/img/vqmt3d/report2/report2_screen_4.png)).  
    Some charts showing overall comparison results are presented in the
    [Overall evaluation
    results](/stereo_quality/report2.html#overall_results)
    section on this page.

Professional stereographers contributed to the analysis with valuable
comments and feedbacks.

### New Sharpness Mismatch Metric

A new metric is presented in the second report for evaluation of the
views correspondence in sharpness.

MSU-3Dfocus-2011 metric, which was presented in the first report, was
used for detailed analyzing of artifacts in examined stereo films. That
metric provided us a valuable assistance while working on the first
report. Meanwhile we have developed an improved metric
(MSU-3Dsharpness-2012).

The new MSU-3Dsharpness-2012 metric enables the following results:

-   More precise values for frames with strong color distortions between
    views;
-   More precise values for frames with large occlusion areas between
    views;
-   More precise values for frames with several regions with sharpness
    mismatch.

Please, see a detailed description of the new metric in Appendix A of
the second report.

## Overall evaluation results

In this section we present overall comparison charts.  
First chart in each subsection (e.g. Depth Budget or Vertical Disparity)
shows average score of each film according to the metric.  
The second chart is an integral histogram which shows distribution of
metric values throughout the film.  
Please, read more about the charts and particular films [in the
report](/stereo_quality/report2.html#download).
