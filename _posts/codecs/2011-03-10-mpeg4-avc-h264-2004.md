## About comparison

***We would like to thank Moonlight Cordless LTD, Fraunhofer Institute
for Integrated Circuits IIS and Ateme for kindly providing us their
codecs for this test.***  
  
Tested codecs:

-   Mpegable AVC Codec
-   Moonlight H.264 Video Codec
-   MainConcept H.264 Codec
-   Fraunhofer IIS Codec
-   Ateme MPEG-4 AVC / H.264 Codec
-   Videosoft H.264 Codec
-   DivX Pro 5.1.1 Codec (**NOT 264!** Used for comparison with H.264
    codecs as well tuned codec from previous generation MPEG-4 ASP)

**[MSU H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Codecs Comparison (3.69Mb,
PDF)](http://compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/pdf/MSU_H264_Comparison_eng.pdf)**  
  
**Current plans:**

-   Codec speed comparison.
-   Codec compatibility comparison.
-   Adding more H.264 codecs to the comparison.

## Main goals

The main idea is to compare the results provided by the new codecs when
they are used by an ordinary user for home video compression. As a rule,
such users prefer simple and popular programs to play DVD movies or
digitize signal from tuner. Also they rarely change default codec's
settings. We understand that it is very hard to create codecs that would
work well on different sequences using the same settings, but this
situation is rather common.

Taking the peculiarities of H.264 standard into consideration (such as
long time of coding when all possibilities are used) we are going to use
2 presets: "tuned" and "fast". First one is used to get maximum quality,
second one is used to ensure fast processing. These presets will be
provided by the codecs developers. Both time and quality will be
measured. This will allow codecs to show their possibilities in terms of
quality and us to compare speed in a more correct way.

Main parts of the comparison:

1.  Comparison in Y-PSNR, U-PSNR and V-PSNR metrics.
2.  Per frame comparison.
3.  Bit rate handling (does your movie fit on the CD?).
4.  Visual comparison.
5.  Informal codecs comparison.

## Comparison with PSNR metric

PSNR - is a metric used to compare 2 pictures: the more per pixel
difference between the pictures is the less is PSNR value. We use the
average value of the per frame PSNR metric to compare two sequences. So
the higher is the codec's line on the graph the better is the quality of
compression performed by this codec.

Y-PSNR is the difference in brightness component, U-PSNR and V-PSNR are
the differences in hue components.

On this picture V-PSNR values are shown. The higher the line is the better is the quality.<br />
</div>
</div>

## Visual codec comparison

In most cases the PSNR value is in accordance with the compression
quality. But sometimes this metric does not reflect presence of some
important visual artefacts. For example, we can't estimate the quality
of the blocking artefacts compensation performed by some codec using
only PSNR metric. Also in some cases it is difficult to say whether 2 dB
difference is significant or not.

That is why we use visual comparison of some frames in addition to the
PSNR images. This won\`t help us to understand the whole situation, but
will allow to demonstrate some interesting features of the codec (e.g.
block artifacts compensation).

<table class="center" style="text-align: center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="/assets/img/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2004/visual_ateme.jpg" alt="Ateme "><br/>
Ateme H.264
</td>

<td>
<img src="/assets/img/codecs/mpeg4-avc-h264-2004/visual_divx.jpg" alt="Divx
3.1 "> <br/> 
Divx 5.1.1
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These pictures present the same frame compressed by two different codecs
with the same bitrate. One can see that Ateme H.264 codec provides a
better compensation of the blocking artifacts.
