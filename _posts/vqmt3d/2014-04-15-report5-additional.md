# MSU Graphics & Media Lab Report #5 on stereo films quality assessment

April 11.—The stereo 3D (S3D) film industry is now experiencing a drop
in interest. Some people even think that the industry is dying and has
no future. And a key factor in its decline is the poor quality of the 3D
content which causes eyestrain and sometimes even severe headaches and
nausea. The Graphics & Media Lab CMC of [Lomonosov Moscow State
University](http://www.msu.ru/en/) (further: the Lab) in cooperation
with [IITP RAS](http://www.iitp.ru/en/about) decided to investigate this
problem.

The Lab already has over 10 years of experience in comprehensive
analysis of quality of compressed video. In the area of 3D video quality
it has already released [4 reports](/stereo_quality/reports/)
since March 2013 presenting the evaluation of 20 S3D films altogether.

The 1, 2, 4 reports were focused on films captured with stereoscopic
camera systems, and the main problems discovered during the film
analysis were:

-   excessive horizontal disparity
-   vertical disparity (Image #1)
-   color mismatch
-   sharpness mismatch

Third report was dedicated to quality analysis of 2D-3D conversion which
introduces a lot of new problems that are absent in captured S3D video.
The analysis included the following common converted S3D video issues:

-   the cardboard effect
-   edge-sharpness mismatch (Image #2)

The Lab received a lot of positive comments from professional
stereographers on these reports and was encouraged to continue the work
on stereo film evaluation. The next two reports will be dedicated to the
analysis of a stereo-window violation effect, which may be especially
annoying in the more visible parts of the image. This issue appears in
both captured and converted S3D films.

And now we would like to introduce the [fifth report](/stereo_quality/report5.html), in which the
analysis of converted S3D films quality was continued. The report
includes the following films:

-   The Avengers
-   The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
-   Gulliver's Travels
-   Immortals
-   Wrath of the Titans

The main new feature introduced in this report is the analysis for
inconsistencies between stereo disparity and motion, which enables the
automated detection of shots where inaccurate depth map was used for
2D-3D conversion (Image #3).

The overall comparison of films in the report includes all 25 films
analyzed in this or previous reports.

## Depth Budget

The report also provides the depth budget chart for both converted S3D
films and captured ones (Image #4). It's clear from this chart that
converted S3D films tend to have lesser depth budgets than those of
captured films.

## Vertical Disparity

It's also noticeable that converted S3D films generally have better
vertical alignment than captured S3D films (Image #5). In fact, *Wrath
of the Titans* has the best vertical alignment among the processed
films.

## Color mismatch

The same refers to color mismatch: the converted S3D films generally
have much better color alignment between the left and right stereoscopic
images (Image #6). However, color mismatch still appears in converted
S3D films and it turned out that color mismatch in *Gulliver's Travels*
is stronger than in *Clash of the Titans*.

## Comparison of 2D & S3D versions

The report also contains a comparison of 2D & S3D versions of all five
films. This research has several goals:

-   Analysis and classification of different 2D-3D conversion
    techniques;
-   Assessment of 2D-3D conversion quality from a slightly different
    perspective;
-   Development of 2D-3D conversion quality-control tools.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the following people for providing valuable
comments, opinions and feedback, which helped to improve this report:

-   **Ido Banai**, Stereographer, Stereo Production Consultant,
    Filmmaker, Storyteller
-   **Robert Black**, 3D R&D, 3D Consultant / Stereographer
-   **Ross Copeland**, Online Editor / Stereographer & Colourist, Post
    Production Consultant
-   **Deepak Dalal**, Associate Stereoscopic Supervisor at Prime Focus
    World
-   **Srboljub Hetlerovic**, Stereographer, VFX Supervisor
-   **Jon Karafin**, Senior Scientist and Director of Production
    Technology at RealD

-   **Greg Passmore**, Director, PassmoreLab
-   **Fabien Remblier**, S3D and 4K Director, Stereographer, Producer
-   **Wesley Sewell**, Stereographic Supervisor

A key motive of this report is to improve the stereo quality and
therefore to reduce eyestrain and headache. The Lab hopes, that a high
3D video quality would contribute to a continually increasing number of
people, leaving the modern theaters without annoyance and with good
impressions from the image quality and storytelling. If you are
concerned about this problem too, please feel free to share the VQMT3D
project [homepage](/stereo_quality/) link. The next
reports on 3D quality will be published in the near future on the
[website](/stereo_quality/reports/).
